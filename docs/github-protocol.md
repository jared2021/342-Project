# **Github Protocol**

## Git Branches

<!-- TODO: List branch names -->

- All of your changes to a certain page should be made on the branch for that page.

- To clone a specific branch use `git checkout <branch name>`, followed by `git
pull`

- Commit like normal. Use `git commit -m <your message>`

- After committing, to push your code to a specific branch use `git push origin
<branch name>`

## Code Review

- After you have committed your code to Github, create a pull request on the [Github]("https://www.github.com") website and ping someone on the team to review your code.

- After you have been approved, you are done and can start working on the next ticket!
